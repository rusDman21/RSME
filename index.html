      <h2>Schoenbeck</h2>
    </a>
    <p>Throughout my life, I’ve always looked for a balance of technology and art - a geek vs beauty adventure. I am a problem solver, a teacher, and a continuous learner.</p>
    <a href="portfolio.html">Please feel free to take a look at a collection of my work.</a>

		<li class="belly feature-img"><p>I currently work at <a href="http://bellycard.com" target="blank">Belly Card</a>. My role is a unique one; I am a Program Coordinator / Jr. Front-End Engineer. Yes, I have a slash in my title! I’m there to promote transparency between the engineering team and every other integral portion of Belly. I get to write awesome code and learn from the most amazing <a href="http://tech.bellycard.com/team/" target="blank">team</a> of engineers I’ve met.</p></li>

		<li class="tsl feature-img"><a href="http://www.starterleague.com/" target="_blank"><p>I previously worked with The Starter League as a Teaching Assistant and student mentor for the HTML and CSS class.

				<p>ReneeFlint.com is one of the first sites I ever built. Renee owns a Tastefully Simple business and needed a central hub for her customers to access her online store and virtual parties that were currently active. The page could use some major refactoring (and a boost in browser support). However, her guests are able to quickly and easily go directly to Renee's online store or choose which virtual party they would like to shop!</p>

		<li class="proj-profile-myballot feature-img">
			<a href="portfolio/exmyballot.html">
				<p>MyBallot was created to assist first-time and inexperienced voters as well as a great tool for anyone to make an informed decision on election day. Any visitor could enter a ZIP code to find out who would be on their ballot, including local positions. Registered users could take notes and save their choices to create a custom voting guide. This was done as a Starter League project in Ruby (on Rails).</p>

			<a href="http://myshoefits.me" target="_blank">
				<p>MyShoeFits.me is a blog that was created to allow my fiance to document her experience of double foot surgery. She opted in to this procedure and reading other blogs really helped her prepare; she wanted to pay it forward! I used <a href="http://lightcms.com" target="_blank">LightCMS</a> as the blogging platform. This allowed me to structure and style pages in my own way. Feel free to take a look, but I warn you: there may be some graphic images!</p>
