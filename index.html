      <h2>Schoenbeck</h2>

    <p>Throughout my life, Iâ€™ve always looked for a balance of technology and art - a geek vs beauty adventure. I am an analytical problem solver to the core and am able to effectively collaborate with all facets of a business. I am a leader that inspires and motivates others. I am a continuous learner, I lead by example, and I know when to humbly ask for help. My fiance and I have just moved to Colorado to pursue new careers and enjoy the mountains!</p>

			<a href="portfolio/exmyballot.html">
				<p>MyBallot was created to assist first-time and inexperienced voters as well as a great tool for anyone to make an informed decision on election day. Any visitor could enter a ZIP code to find out who would be on their ballot, including local positions. Registered users could take notes and save their choices to create a custom voting guide. This was done as a Starter League project in Ruby (on Rails).</p>

				<p>This is my wedding website that I designed and built for our guests as they prepare for our destination wedding in March. The goal was to make this site as legible and easy to use as possible as some of our guests will be older. The site was built with SASS, HTML, and some light JavaScript. It is also responsive for guests to use on the go as our wedding will most likely result in a winter vacation for most. Renee helped with the design as well!</p>

			<a href="http://reneeflint.com" target="_blank">
				<p>ReneeFlint.com is one of the first sites I ever built. Renee owns a Tastefully Simple business and needed a central hub for her customers to access her online store and virtual parties that were currently active. The page could use some major refactoring (and a boost in browser support). However, her guests are able to quickly and easily go directly to Renee's online store or choose which virtual party they would like to shop!</p>

				<p>MyShoeFits.me is a blog that was created to allow my fiance to document her experience of double foot surgery. She opted in to this procedure and reading other blogs really helped her prepare; she wanted to pay it forward! I used <a href="http://lightcms.com" target="_blank">LightCMS</a> as the blogging platform. This allowed me to structure in my own way. Feel free to take a look, but I warn you: there may be some graphic images!</p>

			<p>I previously worked and studied with The Starter League as a Teaching Assistant for the Front-End Web Development class, 'Starter Night' team advisor, and individual student mentor. The Starter League is a beginner's focused school that helps motivated starters learn to build web applications that solve meaningful problems alongside a passionate community. I took design and development classes with <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/">Shay Howe</a> and <a href="http://mig.io/">Mig Reyes</a>.</p></a></li>
		<li class="belly feature-img">
			<p>I've also worked at <a href="http://bellycard.com" target="blank">Belly Card</a>. My role was definitely a unique one; I was a Program Coordinator / Jr. Front-End Engineer. Yes, I had a slash in my title! I was there to promote transparency between the engineering team and every other integral portion of Belly. I got to write awesome code and learn from an amazing team of engineers and designers.</p></li>
