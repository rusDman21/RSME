    <p>Please take a look at a collection of my work below. Each of them have inspiration from different places and some have a different scope. I've also included a few pieces of pure exploration and learning.</p>

				<p>ReneeFlint.com is one of the first sites I ever built. Renee owns a Tastefully Simple business and needed a central hub for her customers to access her online store and virtual parties that were currently active. The page could use some major refactoring (and a boost in browser support). However, her guests are able to quickly and easily go directly to Renee's online store or choose which virtual party they would like to shop!</p>

				<p>MyBallot was created to assist first-time and inexperienced voters as well as a great tool for anyone to make an informed decision on election day. Any visitor could enter a ZIP code to find out who would be on their ballot, including local positions. Registered users could take notes and save their choices to create a custom voting guide. This was done as a Starter League project in Ruby (on Rails).</p>

				<p>MyShoeFits.me is a blog that was created to allow my fiance to document her experience of double foot surgery. She opted in to this procedure and reading other blogs really helped her prepare; she wanted to pay it forward! I used <a href="http://lightcms.com" target="_blank">LightCMS</a> as the blogging platform. This allowed me to structure and style pages in my own way. Feel free to take a look, but I warn you: there may be some graphic images!</p>
